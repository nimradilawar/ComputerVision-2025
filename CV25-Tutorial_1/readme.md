# Python Image Processing Tutorial  

This repository provides a hands-on tutorial on Python-based image processing. It covers data loading, filter implementation, plotting, argument handling, and debugging using **VS Code**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  

1. **DataLoader Class**  
   - Load images from a given folder.  
   - Manage data in a clean and reusable way.  

2. **Filters Class**  
   - Define and apply different types of filters (e.g., inversion, thresholding, Gaussian, etc.).  

3. **Plotter Class**  
   - Responsible for plotting processed images and results.  
   - Includes plotting **2D and 3D Gaussian filters** with both **discrete** and **continuous** gaps.  

4. **Command-line Arguments**  
   - Learn how to make your code user-friendly using `argparse`.  
   - Run Python files directly from the terminal with flexible options.  

5. **Debugging in VS Code**  
   - Step-by-step execution of your Python code using the **VS Code Debugging Console**.
